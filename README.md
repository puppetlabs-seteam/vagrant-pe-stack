# Project Deprecated #

This project has been deprecated and is no longer actively maintained. The
`deprecated` branch and the git history contain all of the code for historical
reference.

A suitable replacement for most use cases is to use the Vagrant plugins `oscar`
and `vagrant-pe_build` directly. Information for those projects can be found
